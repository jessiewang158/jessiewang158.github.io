These projects primarily serve as vehicles for self-education and enjoyment, rather than being highly sophisticated endeavors.

## VR Application for Google Cardboard

The project involves developing a VR application specifically tailored for Google Cardboard, a low-cost VR platform. The application offers users immersive experiences in a fictional world. Through interactive elements, users can explore and engage with the virtual environment. The goal is to provide an accessible and engaging VR experience for educational and entertainment purposes using smartphones and a basic cardboard viewer.

## Edmonton Pothole Detection using Dashcam

This project aims to develop a system that utilizes dashcam footage to detect and analyze potholes on road surfaces. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the system will identify potential potholes from video data captured by the dashcam. Through image processing and machine learning algorithms, it will differentiate between road imperfections and actual potholes, accurately identifying their locations and severity. The system's output can be used to generate real-time alerts for drivers, municipalities, or road maintenance authorities, enabling timely repairs and improving road safety.

## Movie Recommendation Website
This project involves creating a user-friendly website for movie recommendations by leveraging the IMDb database. The website will allow users to search for movies, explore detailed information such as plot summaries, cast, and ratings sourced from IMDb. Utilizing collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation algorithms, the website will offer personalized movie recommendations based on users' preferences and viewing history. Users can also rate movies, add them to watchlists, and share recommendations with others. The goal is to provide an intuitive platform for movie enthusiasts to discover new films and enhance their movie-watching experience based on IMDb's extensive database.

The website is inactive now due to high maitenance cost.
