My name is Jessie. I'm someone who loves exploring new horizons, both in the tech world and in everyday life. Born in a small town in China and now living in Canada, my journey has taken me from studying chemical engineering to diving deep into computer science. My goal? To drive digital transformation, help others embrace and integrate the latest technology.

But life isn't all about work for me. After the computers are off, you can find me on my yoga mat. Yep, I'm also a certified yoga teacher. This helps me stay balanced and open to all the amazing cultures our world has to offer. I'm always up for trying new things, whether it's a new food, a new book, or a new hobby. My life motto is pretty simple: 'I'll try anything once.'

So, whether we're talking about the latest in digital tech or figuring out a new yoga pose, I'm all about mixing the old with the new. If you're into chatting about how technology can change our lives or just looking for someone to try out a new restaurant with, I'm here. Let's see what new adventures we can find together!
